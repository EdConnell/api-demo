# Devbootcamp Auth Demo App
This is a skeleton app using authorization through [Devbootcamp Auth](https://auth.devbootcamp.com).
To use it you'll need to get a client id and secret from Devbootcamp Auth.

## Configuration
You must add your client id, secret, and redirect url as environment variables.
```ruby
ENV['OAUTH_TOKEN'] = # your token
ENV['OAUTH_SECRET'] = # your secret
ENV['OAUTH_REDIRECT'] = # your redirect url
```
